# Clean phone hardening guide
What is a "clean phone"? Check out the [concept](clean_dirty_concept.md).

Most options mentioned in the [dirty phone setup](README.md) are also valid for your clean phone. Here are the differences.

## Installation
You do not need a SIM card for this phone.

If you do not need a Google account (e.g. for installing apps from Play Store), do not set it up.

If you really need one: Create a new and unique Google account for this phone. Make sure to not enter any information that might be connected to your person (don't use your known phone number, your name, your original email address, etc).

# Reducing the attack surface
Do not install *any* app you do not absolutely need. In most cases, you will need a messenger app and a browser.

Disable iMessage and Facetime on iOS devices.

# Messengers
I recommend Threema:

* You can install it without Play Store (and Google account)
* It can be used anonymously (without connecting your phone number or email address; this is very important to disrupt attack chains)
* You can define contacts that are allowed to contact you. All other senders will be blocked.

If your contacts have no phone number and email address associated with their Threema ID, your correspondence is completely anonymous. Even if the phone gets compromised, investigators may struggle to identify the peer.  
Make sure, your contact also follows this guide for best protection.

# Browsers
I still recommend the Firefox browser. But do not use an ad blocker (what if the ad blocker gets compromised?). Do not use it for surfing the web. Use it to download Threema. That's it.

# Your device in a physical world
If you use your clean phone for phone calls, make sure to switch off your dirty phone (it might be compromised and the microphone might be on). You might also want to switch off your phone when you do not want to be tracked physically.

Note that when you enter certain countries, your phone might be taken away to copy data. You might want to wipe your phone before traveling to such countries and recover it later.
